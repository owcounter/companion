## System Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

- Overwatch 2 (Battle.net or Steam version)
- Supported resolutions: 2560x1440 or 1920x1080

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot Detection Issues
- Ensure Overwatch 2 is running in Borderless Windowed or Fullscreen mode
- Verify screenshot folder permissions
- Check if antivirus is blocking the app
- Review `OwcounterCompanion.log` for errors

### Known Screenshot Issues
- The default Print Screen key may activate cursor selection mode, requiring you to press Escape to continue playing
- We recommend binding an additional key (e.g., Home, Page Up/Down) for smoother screenshot capture
- Due to an Overwatch 2 bug, the additional hotkey may stop working temporarily. If this occurs:
  - Use the Print Screen key as a temporary workaround
  - Wait until the next game, or restart Overwatch 2 to restore functionality

### Authentication Issues
- Verify your OWCOUNTER credentials
- Check your internet connection
- Try logging out and back in
- Clear the token file by deleting `owcounter_oauth_token.json`

## Configuration

The app monitors these screenshot locations:
- Battle.net: `Documents/Overwatch/ScreenShots/Overwatch/`
- Steam: `Steam/userdata/<steam_id>/760/remote/2357570/screenshots/`

## Security & Privacy
